Abstract
The purpose was to specify the concept of traditional food and the dimensions that make it up, identifying: definitions, authors and research projects; as well 

as to determine what is known and possible topics for future research. A literature review of traditional foods was conducted that examined the conceptual development of the term. Social network analysis (SNA) was also used to identify the most relevant definitions and working groups on the topic. Twenty-three definitions were identified in the period 1995â€“2019.
